Hello World
I want to share and catalog my lifetime experiences
2020-11-09

Writing was always a hard task to me, although I deeply write technical documents,
I am usually too concerned on how things should sound or look like, style or if I am complicating too much.

Time is passing faster than ever, I find myself much more concentrate on tasks these days than before,
I give much more importance to things and dedicate a considerable amount of time to each of them. This of course affects how I perceive time and when I see, a whole week passed by or even a day. I am enjoying tho, myself and my
state better than ever, and with that, I want to start documenting it.

This will also take an important role by teaching me how better to communicate my ideas, or how
to express myself in a clear away. As an expat whose interacts with many cultures through the day, communicating
is always a very challenging task on my desk.

Another clearly aspect of time is memory, I am starting to notice how is it like to forget things, and mainly how
hard it is to remember recently learned topics. Having a place where I can catalog my learn process or document things
that I feel important will help me pretty much later on.

There is also the time of giving back — at least attempt to that — a little. I have been coding for quite sometime, dealt with many projects and teams, I may have something to share.
