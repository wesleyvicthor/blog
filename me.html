My studies in the subject date 2006 but only in 2008 I got my first role as an engineer.

Ever since, I have designed, developed and maintained applications written in PHP, ASP, Javascript,
ActionScript and most recently Go.

In 2016 I had my first market experience with Go and consequently made it my primary programming language. In that same
year I had a chance to move to Germany making it my home country.

I want to keep designing software tools and distributed systems using Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS and Kubernetes.

Here is a list of markets and domains which I have faced, building frameworks, tools and web services
<ul>
    <li>Telecom Gateways</li>
    <li>B2B Digital Asset Management(local file system and files metadata)</li>
    <li>ERP(Telecom)</li>
    <li>Retail(B2B and B2C Marketplaces)</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Local Search</li>
    <li>Supply Chain</li>
</ul>

Open source projects which I have contributed to are:
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/XSAM/otelsql">XSAM/otelsql</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Respect/Validation">Respect/Validation</a></li>
</ul>

I play the Guitar, I replaced Skateboarding for Tennis and I keep close contact with Cinema and Film.
