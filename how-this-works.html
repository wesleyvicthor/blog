How this works ?
It's a dance of Golang, AWS and Let's Encrypt
2020-12-20

When I decided to start sharing something publicly I took months to choose on which would be
the approach that would fit my goal, should I do GitHub Pages, Medium, bring up a Wordpress, or
some statically blog tool like Jenkyll or Hugo. As a core Software Engineer, and a passion to craft I
chose the not so straight forward path and a more laborious one.

This site is a tiny golang application whose you can find <a href="https://github.com/wesleyvicthor/blog" target="_blank">here</a>, the content is served from
an AWS EC2 Micro instance. It has only 1GB of RAM and something more than this of storage â€” which I do not use.
The posts were supposed to be fetched from S3, maybe soon... It uses PureCSS and Microdata Schema for structuring its information.

Configure Let's Encrypt took a bit longer as the support on AMI 2 Image from Amazon was not so straight forward
in order to enable snapd to support Let's Encrypt I had to fork a <a href="https://github.com/albuild/snap" target="_blank">snap install solution</a> and fix the version to download
the right release for the environment.

There are a few more things which I want to add such as a security mechanism for requests and a some rss,
but for the moment I think it attends the needs.
